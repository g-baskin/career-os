# Career OS

Career OS is the first flagship implementation of a reusable event-driven automation platform.

The platform layer provides the System Kernel, Domain Registry, Command Bus, Event Store, State Store, Snapshot Store, orchestration, configuration, security, trust and safety, scheduling, notifications, integrations, AI, reasoning, knowledge, memory, observability, QA, recovery, workflow, and mission primitives.

Career OS runs on that platform as a career-management product for job intelligence, application packets, relationships, documents, interviews, follow-ups, and career growth.

## Architecture

Every domain follows:

```text
Domain → Manager → Capability → Worker → Tool → Event → State Projection → UI Workspace
```

The platform is designed so future products such as Sales OS, Grant OS, Real Estate OS, Recruiting OS, Client Acquisition OS, Agency Operations OS, Compliance OS, and Healthcare Operations OS can reuse the same architecture later.

## Phase 1 foundation

- Next.js dashboard shell with workspaces for missions, jobs, applications, relationships, documents, follow-ups, settings, health, and domain registry.
- Worker app scaffold using BullMQ and Redis.
- Prisma/Postgres schema covering events, state, snapshots, companies, jobs, applications, documents, people, email, calendar, follow-up, and intelligence records.
- Domain registry and placeholders for required domains.
- Greenhouse and Lever collectors, Ashby placeholder, manual URL importer, job normalization, remote classification, clearance segmentation, and basic fit scoring.

## Phase 2 foundation

- Job Intelligence pipeline scaffold.
- Application Packet service scaffold.
- Resume and cover-letter placeholder generation.
- Relationship dedupe scaffold.
- Daily Mission v2 surfaces.
- API route scaffolds for pipeline, packets, relationships, and mission data.

## Phase 3 durable stores

- Prisma-backed Event Store for permanent event history.
- Prisma-backed State Store for current truth projections.
- Prisma-backed Snapshot Store for point-in-time source data with checksums.
- In-memory store implementations preserved for tests and lightweight local usage.
- Read API routes for `/api/events`, `/api/state`, and `/api/snapshots`.

## Phase 4 command execution

- Shared `CareerCommand` and `CommandResult` contracts.
- Command Bus for handler registration and command execution.
- Orchestrator for registry-backed domain routing and command lifecycle audit events.
- Job pipeline, application packet, and relationship dedupe API routes submit commands instead of calling services directly.

## Phase 5 human approval gates

- Permission policy service returns allowed, denied, or requires-approval decisions.
- Sensitive commands create approval requests instead of executing automatically.
- Approval lifecycle events preserve audit history.
- Approval API routes and a basic `/approvals` page expose pending and decided requests.
- `/approvals` includes local demo buttons for allowed, approval-required, and denied commands.
- Dev demo routes under `/api/dev/commands/*` exercise policy without sending email, using a browser, uploading files, or submitting applications.
- Trusted mode placeholders remain disabled.

## Phase 6 approved command replay

- Approved requests can be replayed through Approval Service → Command Bus → Orchestrator → Permission Policy → Domain Manager.
- Replay status and results are persisted on the approval request.
- Completed replay is idempotent and returns the stored result on repeat clicks.
- Local `email.send` replay is demo-only and records `externalActionTaken: false`.
- Denied `application.auto_submit` commands remain non-replayable.

## Phase 7 Resume Factory v1

- Resume Factory v1 generates truthfulness-guarded resume drafts from supplied verified facts only.
- `POST /api/resumes` routes through the Command Bus, Orchestrator, Resume Factory Domain, Event Store, State Store, and Snapshot Store.
- `/resumes` provides a local demo workspace with a Splunk / Cribl Platform Engineer payload, markdown preview, truthfulness status, keyword alignment, and safety warnings.
- CISSP, Security+, clearance, fake employers, and fake metrics remain unclaimed unless they are supplied as verified facts and pass the guard.

## Resume Factory local demo

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/resumes` and click `Generate Demo Splunk/Cribl Resume`.

Confirm the preview appears, truthfulness status appears, CISSP/Security+/clearance are not invented, and no email/upload/submit/apply action happened.

## Safety rules

Career OS requires human approval before sending emails, submitting applications, answering sensitive questions, contacting recruiters for the first time, modifying the master profile, exporting AI-generated documents for real use, or uploading files to unknown sites.

LinkedIn scraping, CAPTCHA bypassing, proxy scraping, email sending, browser automation, and auto-submit are intentionally excluded from the current foundation.
